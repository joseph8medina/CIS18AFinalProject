# CIS18AFinalProject
Winter 2024 CIS-18A Final Project: Business Booking System Program

This program was designed and created to let users book an appointment with a hypothetical Mobile detailing service. This program allows the user to pick a date, choose the type of car they wish to be serviced, the type of detailing package, and whether it is a house call or not. If it is a house call, the user is prompted to enter their address. This program implements JFrame, JCalendar, and Windows Builder for the Graphical User Interface.
